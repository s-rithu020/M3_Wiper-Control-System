# Wiper Control System

The Wiper Control System is an automated system present in an automotive vehicle, such as a car, which keeps the windshield of the vehicle clear from rain water, dust, snow and road spray. The Wiper Control System controls the windshield wipers of the vehicle. 

Previous vehicle designs had wipers that had to be operated manually by moving a lever inside a car. Nowadays, almost all vehicles utilize an electric motor and are activated and controlled by a knob beside the steering wheel. The wiper blade speed can be adjusted by the driver. 

Most of the cars have two wipers systems on the windshield, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wipers have various observable parts such as the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has six parts known as claws which are small arms under the wiper. The automotive wipers are controlled by a microcontroller.

Many wiper systems in cars today use a rain sensor to detect the speed at which the raindrops are falling on the windshield. A microcontroller or microprocessor evaluates the signals from the sensor to calculate the speed at which the wipers should move.
